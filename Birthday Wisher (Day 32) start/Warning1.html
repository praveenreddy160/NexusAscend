  <title>Coding Challenge - Special Warning!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hey [Friend's Name],</p>

  <p>I'm just letting you know that I'm about to crush you in the coding world.
    You better watch out because I'm coming for the top spot, and you won't
    even see my taillights.</p>

  <p>Consider this your official warning. Don't even think about messing with me
    or making any snide comments about my skills. You'll regret it.</p>

  <p>Prepare to be humbled,<br>
  Praveen Reddy</p>
